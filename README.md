# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

This repository contains an analysis project focused on the Seoul Bike Demand Prediction dataset. The project aims to analyze and predict bike demand in Seoul based on various factors such as weather conditions, date, time, and other relevant features.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of information related to bike rentals in Seoul, including factors that influence demand. The dataset contains various features such as:


Date: Date of the bike demand observation (date)

Rented Bike Count: Number of bikes rented on a particular day (numeric)

Hour: Hour of the day when the observation was made (numeric)

Temperature: Temperature in Celsius (numeric)

Humidity: Humidity percentage (numeric)

Wind Speed: Wind speed in meters per second (numeric)

Visibility: Visibility distance in meters (numeric)

Dew Point Temperature: Dew point temperature in Celsius (numeric)

Solar Radiation: Solar radiation in MegaJoules per square meter (numeric)

Rainfall: Amount of rainfall in millimeters (numeric)

Snowfall: Amount of snowfall in centimeters (numeric)

Seasons: Season of the year (categorical)

Holiday: Whether it is a holiday or not (binary: 1 if holiday, 0 if not)

Functioning Day: Whether it is a functioning day or not (binary: 1 if functioning day, 0 if not)

# Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:


Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the Seoul bike demand dataset.

Analyze the relationship between bike demand and various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasons.

Identify the most influential features affecting bike demand.

Build machine learning models to predict bike demand based on the given features.

Evaluate the performance of the prediction models using appropriate metrics.

Visualize the patterns and trends in the dataset using charts and graphs.

Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis for bike rental service providers.
